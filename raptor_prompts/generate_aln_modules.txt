Raptor-mini Prompt: Generate ALN modules to replace Python CI/tools

Role: Senior ALN CI engineer

Goal: Replace any Python-based CI scripts with ALN modules and ensure GitHub Actions uses only ALN for linting, tests, and builds.

Steps:
1) Scan the repository for any Python scripts under `ci/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, or `.github` that are called by GitHub Actions workflows, Makefiles, or Dockerfiles.
2) For each referenced Python script, generate an ALN module that:
   - Preserves behavior, args, env vars, exit codes, and logging.
   - Uses ALN stdlib where possible.
   - Exposes `export fn main() -> int` as the entrypoint.
   - Lives under a namespace like `ci.lint`, `ci.test`.
3) Write modules into an `aln/ci/` directory using `.aln` files and propose file names.
4) Provide unified Git diffs:
   - Add the new ALN modules.
   - Update `.github/workflows/*.yml`, Makefiles, and Dockerfiles to call `aln run <module>`.
5) Ensure generated code is deterministic and safe for GitHub Actions.

Outputs:
- Full ALN module code for each CI task.
- Edited workflow YAML snippets for invoking the new modules.
- A short checklist of remaining scripts safe to keep.
